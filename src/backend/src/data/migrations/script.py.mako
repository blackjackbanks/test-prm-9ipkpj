Revision ID: ${revision}
Revises: ${down_revision | comma,n}
Create Date: ${create_date}

Branch Labels: ${branch_labels | comma,n}
Dependencies: ${depends_on | comma,n}

Migration Type: Schema Change
Deployment Type: Blue-Green Compatible
Estimated Duration: TBD
Rollback Safety: Safe

Description:
    Detailed description of the migration purpose and changes.
    
Prerequisites:
    - List any required conditions before running this migration
    - Document any dependent migrations or system states
    
Deployment Instructions:
    1. Deploy new version with migration pending
    2. Execute migration with --sql flag to generate SQL
    3. Review generated SQL for backward compatibility
    4. Apply migration in blue environment
    5. Verify data integrity and application functionality
    6. Switch traffic to blue environment
    7. Apply migration in green environment
    
Validation Steps:
    Pre-Migration:
        - Verify database connectivity
        - Check required permissions
        - Validate data prerequisites
        
    Post-Migration:
        - Verify schema changes
        - Validate data integrity
        - Check application functionality
        - Confirm backward compatibility
        
Rollback Procedure:
    1. Execute downgrade migration
    2. Verify data restoration
    3. Confirm system functionality
